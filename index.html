<h1> My Interest </h1>
    Some of my interest include cars, sports, and mma. My interest for cars started at a young age as I was influenced by my dad we have always worked on cars together whether it was a dirt bike or his classic truck I was always out helping him work on them. 
I have always been a part of a sport, I started playing baseball at a young age later on I started wrestling and playing football. But eventually I started branching out learing to skateboard and to snowboard. Keeping myself busy learning new things has always been something that makes me happy and I hope it stays that way.
My interest in MMA started when my parents watched UFC, this passion also came from my time wrestling. My favorite fighter is Demetrius Johnson, he is a very tough fighter and is well rounded in all styles, but he is know for his striking which always makes for a great fight.
