<head> About Me </head>
<h1> My Interest </h1>
<body>  Some of my interest include cars, sports, and mma. My interest for cars started at a young age as I was influenced by my dad we have always worked on cars together whether it was a dirt bike or his classic truck I was always out hwlping him work on them.
<br> I have always been a part of a sport, I started playing baseball at a young age later on I started wrestling and playing football. But eventually I started branching out learing to skateboard and to snowboard. Keeping myself busy learning new things has always been something that makes me happy and I hope it stays that way.
<br> My interest in MMA started when my parents watched UFC, this passion also came from my time wrestling. My favorite fighter is Demetrius Johnson, he is a very tough fighter and is well rounded in all styles, but he is know for his striking which always makes for a great fight.
